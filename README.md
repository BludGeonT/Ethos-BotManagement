# Ethos-BotManagement

This module is to manage the Telegram Bot Accounts that we create from a verified Telegram account.  

In the first versions of this, we will explore the layout and how to display things and then how to add, edit, delete, assign, enable, and disable bots.

Further description will be added here.

# Refer to the UI.md file for the layout instructions and retaining all of the rules within the original PLANNING.md file.
